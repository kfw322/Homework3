My name is Kyrus Wankadiya. I am 25 years old. I am an Charlotte Hornets, Carolina Panthers, and South Carolina Gamecocks fan. I joined the UNCC Data Analytics Boot Camp as a way to enter the fields of business and data, while still utilizing my experience in the software field. After this boot camp, I intend to enroll in UNCC's Business Analytics program. My unrelated hobbies include basketball, racquet sports, drumming, and video games. I also enjoy traveling to new places and have been to 28 states. I have lived in Rhode Island, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, North Carolina again, North Dakota, and North Carolina a third time. These are long words: antidisestablishmentarianism and pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. I put these last two sentences in here for only two reasons- to test how my code handles hyphens and colons, and to bring the total number of sentences to 10 sentences and the word count to 155 words.
